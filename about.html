        <h2>our story</h2>

        <p>
          Our story began long before this project had a name.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you grew up in our community, you’ve seen it too — the quiet ways harm shows up in our everyday lives. 
          The jokes that aren’t really jokes. The way young men talk about women when they think no one is listening. 
          The way young women learn, far too early, to shrink themselves or to excuse behaviour that chips away at 
          their safety and self-worth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Violence sits at every corner of our community, sometimes loud and obvious, sometimes soft and familiar. 
          And for a lot of us, it became normal… until it didn’t. Until we started paying attention to the patterns. 
          Until we realized just how many young people were falling into cycles of control, manipulation, and harm 
          long before adulthood.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>by their side</em> was created to interrupt that cycle — with empathy, with conversation, and with the 
          belief that our community deserves more than survival. We deserve care, accountability, and spaces where 
          young people can talk honestly about their relationships, their identities, and the kind of love they hope 
          to receive and give.
        </p>

        <h2 class="vision-heading">our vision</h2>

        <p>
          We imagine a community where young people have the tools, skills, and confidence to build relationships 
          rooted in honesty, respect, and care — not fear.
        </p>

        <p>
          A community where young women, gender-diverse people, and young men all sit at the table together, learning 
          how to unlearn what harms us and relearn what heals us. Because preventing violence isn’t the work of one 
          group — it’s a cultural shift, and we all have a role in shaping it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our vision is a world where young people get to grow in safety, kindness, joy, and love — supported not just 
          to avoid harm, but to build relationships they’re proud of.
